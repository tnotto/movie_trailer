This project requires THREE scripts:
  media.py
  entertainment_center.py
  fresh_tomatoes.py

and THREE standard Python libraries:
  webbrowser
  os
  re

To run the project run:
  > python entertainment_center.py

Steps:
  1. entertainment_center.py builds the movie instances by using the Movie class
     from media.py
  2. entertainment_center.py passes the movie instances to fresh_tomatoes.py
     which then builds the HTML code

Output:
  In the same directory as entertainment_center.py a new file (fresh_tomatoes.html)
  should be created
